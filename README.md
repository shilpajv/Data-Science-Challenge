# Data-Science-Challenge
Receipt Matching Task
# [Receipt matcher](Receipt Pic.png)
<br>This project aims to build a receipt -transaction matcher that  should be able to take a number of‘transaction-receipt’ matches and order them with the most likely to be correct at the top of the list.<br><br>

# Dataset Used
Check Artifacts (private dataset)

# Libraries Used:
 1. Sci-kit Learn
 2. Xgboost
 3. Pickle
 4. Pandas
 5. Numpy

 
 # Steps used for Running:
 a. Created the ML model after running certain experiments and saved it using pickle.The best model achieved 0.99 recall .<br>
 b. Loaded the saved file and calling the main function to perform predictions from predict file .<br>
 c. Output file is created which generated likelihood of matched outputs <br>
